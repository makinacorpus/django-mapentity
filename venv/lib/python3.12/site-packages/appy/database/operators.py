# Searching objects in the database is done via method
# appy.model.base.Base::search and variants. This method accepts keyword
# arguments to define such searches. These arguments mention indexed fields.
# Workflow state is one example of default indexed field. For example, searching
# all users being active can be done via any object, like this:
#
#               activeUsers = o.search('User', state='active')
#
# On this example, keyword argument named "state" takes the value "active".
# Instead of specifying such a single value, one may use operators to define a
# set or range of values. Such operators are defined in this module. For
# example, the "or" operator could be used as value for keyword argument "state"
# to retrieve users being in states "active" or "inactive", like this:
#
#         moreUsers = o.search('User', state=or_('active', 'inactive'))
#
# As PEP8 recommends it, the operator, also being a Python reserved keyword, is
# suffixed with an underscore. The search hereabove retrieves all users being
# active or inactive.
#
# For multivalued fields, operator "and" can also be used. In the following
# example, we suppose the existence of an indexed field named "attributes" on
# class User, that can hold one or more values among
#
#                      ["married", "employed", "faithful"]
# 
# Getting all users being married as well as employed, being active or not, is
# done via:
#
# someUsers = o.search('User', state=or_('active', 'inactive'),
#                              attributes=and_('married', 'employed'))
#
# The "in" operator allows to define ranges. Getting all users having an IQ
# between 130 and 155 is expressed like this:
#
#                 smartUsers = o.search('User', iq=in_(130, 155))
#
# The "not" operator allows to define all users not statisfying some condition
# based on some indexed field. Suppose the user workflow defines these states:
# active, inactive and registered (=requires validation from a Manager).
# Getting all users not being inactive can be done via:
#
#           awareUsers = o.search('User', state=not_('inactive'))
# 
# The "search" method can accept any number of keyword arguments; values for
# these latters can be simple values or operator values.
#
# Every such operator corresponds to a class in this module. All these classes
# inherit from an abstract base class named Operator. Using operators like in
# the previous examples creates instances of the concrete classes from this
# module. These classes are made available in the appy.all module, so are
# available in any module from your app where you have used the standard import
# statement:
#                           from appy.all import *
