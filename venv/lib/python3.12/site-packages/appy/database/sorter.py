    #         | structure (see appy/database/lazy.py). The sorter produces an
    #         | intermediary data structure that is more complex than a list.
    #         | Instead of directly and completely "flattening" this data
    #         | structure into a list of IIDs, we wrap it, for performance
    #         | reasons, into a Lazy data structure, that behaves like a list
    #         | and manipulates, behind the scenes, the more complex internal
    #         | structure.
