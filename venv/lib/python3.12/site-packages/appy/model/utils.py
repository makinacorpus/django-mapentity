class Object:

       class (methods, attributes,...) we will use this minimalist class.'''

    # Warning - This class is particular: attribute access has been modified in
    #           such a way that AttributeError is never raised.
    #
    # Example:                 o = Object(a=1)
    #
    # >>> o.a
    # >>> 1
    # >>> o.b
    # >>>                      (None is returned)
    # >>> hasattr(o, 'a')
    # >>> True
    # >>> hasattr(o, 'b')
    # >>> True                 It's like if any attribute was defined on it
    # >>> 'a' in o
    # >>> True
    # >>> 'b' in o
    # >>> False

    # While this behaviour may be questionable and dangerous, it can be very
    # practical for objects that can potentially contain any attribute (like an
    # object representing HTTP request parameters or form values). Code getting
    # attribute values can be shorter, freed from verbose "hasattr" calls.
    # Conclusion: use this class at your own risk, if you know what you are
    # doing (isn't it the Python spirit?)
