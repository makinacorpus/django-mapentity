        # to define an action on a list of objects being results of a search
        # (= a "multi-action"). Here are the steps to follow to define such a
        # multi-action.
        #- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
        #  1 | Define an Action field on your class, with its "show" attribute
        #    | being "query" (or a method returning it) in order to tell Appy
        #    | that the action will not be rendered on an object's standard
        #    | layout ("view", "cell"...) but on the "query" layout,
        #    | representing the page displaying search results.
        #    | 
        #    | If you choose to define a method in "show", it must be an
        #    | instance method as usual, but the method will be called with the
        #    | tool as single arg, instead of an instance of your class. In
        #    | order to clearly identify this little cheat, name this first arg
        #    | "tool" instead of "self".
        #- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
        #  2 | Defining an action field on the "query" layout, as explained in
        #    | the previous step, prevents the field from being shown on the
        #    | standard object's layouts, but does not automatically display the
        #    | action on search results from all searches defined in your class.
        #    | In order to "activate" the action on a given search, you must
        #    | explicitly declare it in attribute "actions" of your search.
        #    |
        #    | Here is an example.
        #    |
        #    | Class Invoice:
        #    |    warnClient = Action(show='query', action=lambda...)
        #    |    search = [Search('paid', state='paid'),
        #    |              Search('unpaid', state='unpaid',
        #    |                     actions=(warnClient,))]
        #    |
        #    | In this example, action "warnClient" allowing to send a mail to
        #    | clients having not paid their invoices yet are shown only on
        #    | search results for the search displaying unpaid invoices, but not
        #    | on the one showing paid invoices.
        #    |
        #    | If, conversely, you want to define an action on all searches of a
        #    | given class, here is the recommended technique.
        #    |
        #    | Class A:
        #    |    sendInfo = Action(show='query', action=lambda...)
        #    |    p = {actions: (sendInfo,)}
        #    |    search = [Search('paid', state='paid', **p),
        #    |              Search('unpaid', state='unpaid', **p)]
        #    |    # For advanced and live searches
        #    |    searchAdvanced = Search('advanced', **p)
        #    |
        #    | Finally, if your class defines dynamic searches (via static
        #    | method getDynamicSearches), you have full control on the creation
        #    | of the Search instances: it is up to you to add or not "actions"
        #    | parameters when appropriate. Recall that attribute
        #    | "searchAdvanced" can itself be dynamic: it can be defined as a
        #    | static method accepting the tool as unique arg.
        #- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
        #  3 | The method(s) defined in p_self.action will have these
        #    | particularities:
        #    | - as for a "show" method, it will receive the tool as first arg,
        #    |   and not an instance of your class;
        #    | - it will receive a list of objects (= the search results), in an
        #    |   arg that must be named "objects".
        #    | Moreover, if your search is defined with checkboxes=True, your
        #    | method(s) "objects" will contain only objects being checked in
        #    | the UI.
        #- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
