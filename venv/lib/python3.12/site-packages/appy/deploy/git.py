        # For a Git repository, it is not possible to define login/password
        # credentials: public-key authentication is used instead. The Git repo
        # must be configured with your public key; the machine running the
        # import must either store the private key, or transmit it from your
        # development machine. This latter option is preferable and is achieved
        # by defining the deployment machine as a SSH forward agent. Here is an
        # example.

        # Suppose you have your development machine D. In your home folder, you
        # have a .ssh folder, containing your private and public keys. Via the
        # Appy deployer, you want to deploy code on some production machine P,
        # named some.machine.net. You have configured the SSH daemon on P to be
        # able to log on P with your public key. If, in your .ssh folder (on D),
        # you add a file named "config" and containing the following content,
        # when the Appy deployer will, from machine P, try to download or update
        # the code from some repository machine M, it will transmit your private
        # key without storing it on P, and the download/update will be done.
        #
        # Host some.machine.net
        #   ForwardAgent yes
        #
        # Note that the SSH daemon on P must be configured as a forward agent.
