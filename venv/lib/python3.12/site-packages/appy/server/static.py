        # will be stored in dict Static.ram defined on class Static below.
        # Attribute "ramRoot" hereafter defines the base path, after the

        # resource. It defaults to "ram".

        # server startup, the content of resources. The hereabove example was
        # not randomly chosen: Appy CSS files like appy.css are actually
        # template files containing variables that need to be replaced by their
        # actual values, coming from the app's (ui) config.
        #
        # Currently, such RAM resources include all CSS and SVG files.
        #
        # When adding keys in Static.ram, ensure the key is a filename-like
        # name: the MIME type will be deduced from the file extension.

        # forcing the browser to reload it. Consider this entry:
        #
        #                         'appy.js': 2
        #
        # If your app was deployed with some earlier Appy version, at the time
        # 'appy.js' was 1, appy.js was included via
        #
        #     <script src="https://your.app/static/appy/appy.js?1</script>
        #
        # and was cached by the browser. Now that a new version of this
        # Javascript file comes with the new version of Appy, with 'appy.js'
        # being 2, the next time you will deploy your app, appy.js will be
        # included with:
        #
        #     <script src="https://your.app/static/appy/appy.js?2</script>
