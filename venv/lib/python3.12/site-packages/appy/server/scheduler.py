'''The scheduler manages cron-like actions being programmed and automatically
   executed by the Appy server, as "virtual" requests.'''

# Important notes  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#
# 1. The scheduler runs in "best effort" mode. Everytime a series of jobs must
#    be run according to the current time, they are ran, sequentially, in the
#    order of their definition. If their execution takes several minutes, during
#    this period, the scheduler will not trigger any other job.

#    Example
#    The scheduler is configured with 3 jobs, in that order:
#    - job A must be run at midnight     (cron syntax: 0   0 * * *) ;
#    - job B must be run every 3 minutes (cron syntax: */3 * * * *) ;
#    - job C must be run at 00:15        (cron syntax: 15  0 * * *).

#    At midnight, the scheduler determines that both jobs A and B must be run.
#    - job A is ran at 00:00 and takes 34 minutes to execute ;
#    - job B is ran at 00:34 and takes 30 seconds ;
#    - job B's next execution is at 00:36, then at 00:39, etc.

#    Analysis
#    a) The first execution of job B didn't occur at 00:00, neither at 00:03,
#       but after job A has completely terminated.
#    b) From 00:00 to 00:34, job B was not executed, although, according to its
#       timedef, it should have run every 3 minutes during this period.
#    c) Job C was not executed at all. Indeed, at 00:15, the scheduler was busy
#       with the execution of job A and was blocked, preventing him to detect
#       any other job execution. Job C's next execution will be the day after,
#       at 00:15, excepted if, again, execution of jobs A + B takes more than 15
#       minutes.
#    d) When the scheduler "wakes up" at 00:34, after having executed job A, he
#       does not "look backwards" to check whether other jobs should have been
#       run in the meanwhile, executing job C once, and job B as many times as
#       required between 00:00 and 00:34. No. Instead, he executes the other job
#       (job B) tha was also planned at midnight, he ignores everything
#       scheduled between 00:00 and 00:34 and continues to check for jobs,
#       starting at 00:35.

# 2. The scheduler delays any incoming HTTP request. While jobs are executed by
#    the scheduler, the infinite server loop, used by the server to check for
#    incoming HTTP requests, is paused. The next HTTP request will be handled
#    after all currently running jobs have ended.

#    So, it is preferable to "size" your jobs into a series of "short-term"
#    jobs, triggered at regular intervals, rather than defining "long-lasting"
#    jobs, excepted if you are sure these latter are run when no web user is
#    there, ie, during the night.

# 3. What has been said in items 1 and 2 hereabove mainly holds for unthreaded
#    jobs, being the sole type of jobs in early Appy versions. A threaded job is
#    ran as a separate thread (one from the same pool of threads as the one used
#    for handling incoming HTTP requests).
