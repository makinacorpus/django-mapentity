        # p_stylesMapping. You can also (b) alter the outline level of every
        # style found in your POD template, via dict p_stylesOutlineDeltas,
        # whose keys are style names and values are deltas to apply to their
        # outline levels. Finally, (c), if the input(s) to function "xhtml" is
        # valid HTML but not valid XHTML, specify p_html being True.

        # If you specify a function in p_finalizeFunction (or a list/tuple of
        # functions), it will be called by the renderer before re-zipping the
        # ODT/S result. This way, you can still perform some actions on the
        # content of the ODT/S file before it is zipped and potentially
        # converted. Every such function must accept 2 args:
        #  *  the absolute path to the temporary folder, containing the
        #     un-zipped content of the ODT/S result;
        #  *  the Renderer instance.

        # If you set p_overwriteExisting to True, the renderer will overwrite
        # the result file. Else, an exception will be thrown if the result file
        # already exists.

        # If p_raiseOnError is False (the default value), any error encountered
        # during the generation of the result file will be dumped into it, as a
        # Python traceback within a note. Else, the error will be raised. If the
        # template is an ODS template, exceptions cannot be dumped as inner
        # notes: p_raiseOnError is forced to True, whatever value you may have
        # passed to the Renderer.

        # When, in the process of converting a chunk of XHTML code to ODF, a
        # "img" tag is encountered, POD performs a HTTP GET to retrieve it. If
        # the image is stored on the same server running POD, this can be
        # problematic in two ways:
        # 1) regarding performance, it would be better to retrieve the image
        #    from disk;
        # 2) via HTTP, POD may not be allowed to retrieve the image.
        # In order to overcome these problems, place a function in "findImage".
        # While converting chunks of XHTML code, everytime an "img" tag is
        # encountered, this function will be called, with the image URL as
        # unique arg. If the function returns the absolute path to the image, it
        # will be used instead of performing a HTTP GET request. If the function
        # returns None (ie: it has detected that is is a "truly external" URL),
        # the HTTP GET will nevertheless be performed.

        # If p_rotateImages is True, for every image to inject in the result,
        # Appy will call ImageMagick to read EXIF data. If an orientation is
        # defined, ImageMagick will be called to effectively apply the
        # corresponding rotation to the image. Because reading EXIF data on
        # every image to import may take some processing, p_rotateImages is
        # False by default.

        # p_stylesTemplate can be the path to a LibreOffice file (ie, a .ott
        # file) whose styles will be imported within the result.

        # p_optimalColumnWidths corresponds to the homonym option to
        # converter.py, excepted that values "True" or "False" must be boolean
        # values. Note that the POD function "xhtml" requires this parameter to
        # be "OCW_.*" to be fully operational. When p_optimalColumnWidths is not
        # False, forceOoCall is forced to True.

        # p_distributeColumns corresponds to the homonym option to converter.py,
        # excepted that values "True" or "False" must be boolean values. Note
        # that the POD function "xhtml" requires this parameter to be "DC_.*" to
        # be fully operational. When p_distributeColumns is not False,
        # forceOoCall is forced to True.

        # p_script is the absolute path to a Python script containing functions
        # that the converter will call in order to customize the process of
        # manipulating the document via the LibreOffice UNO interface. For more
        # information, see appy/pod/converter.py, option "-s". Note that when
        # such p_script is specified, p_forceOoCall is forced to True.

        # By default, POD expressions and statement parts are evaluated using
        # the Python built-in "eval" function. If you consider this to be a
        # security problem (are POD templates written by external people ? by
        # advanced users ?), you can use pod in conjunction with the third-party
        # module named RestrictedPython:
        #
        #              https://restrictedpython.readthedocs.io
        #
        # In order to do so, pass, in attribute p_evaluator, an instance of
        # class appy.pod.restricted.Evaluator. For more information and options,
        # consult appy.pod.restricted.py.

        #           | footers) will be correctly imported for all included
        #           | sub-documents. The "do... pod" statement automatically
        #           | sets this parameter to "rename";

        #           | also restart, in the sub-document, page numbering at this
        #           | integer value. It will only work if page styles are
        #           | explicitly applied to pages in the sub-pod template. In
        #           | order to achieve this with LibreOffice, open your

        # If you want to replace (some) fields with their "hard-coded" values,

        # must be included in a master document (via statement "do ... from
        # pod"), but the total number of pages must be kept as is. If
        # p_resolveFields is True, all fields will be resolved, excepted special
        # ones like PageNumber. Indeed, its value is different from one page to
        # another, so resolving it to a single, hard-coded value has no sense.
        # You can also specify "PageCount" as value for p_resolveField. In this
        # case, only the field(s) containing the total number of pages will be
        # resolved. Use it if it is the only field you need to resolve, it will

        # If this renderer is called by another one (its "parent"), it may

        # we do not delete it (the parent will do it at the end of the whole

        # it has a little impact on performance and on the size of the p_result
        # (especially large ods results).

        # template is an official document ending with some director's scanned
        # signature. Just before this signature, the document body is inserted
        # using m_renderXhtml. Depending on p_s's length, in some cases, the
        # scanned signature may end up alone on the last page. When using
        # p_keepWithNext, POD applies a specific style to p_s's last paragraph,
        # such that it will get standard LibreOffice property "keep-with-next"
        # and will thus be "pushed" on the last page, together with the scanned
        # signature, even if there is still space available on the previous one.

        # p_keepWithNext may hold the following values.
        #- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        #     | also works if the last paragraph is a bulleted or numbered item.

        #  >1 | If p_keepWithNext is higher than 1, it represents a number of
        #     | characters to "keep-with-next". Indeed, in some cases, keeping
        #     | only the last paragraph may not be sufficient: a bit more text
        #     | could produce a better result. Based on this number of
        #     | characters, POD will determine how many paragraphs will get
        #     | property "keep-with-next" and will apply it to all of them. For
        #     | example, suppose p_keepWithNext is defined to 60. The last 3
        #     | paragraphs contain, respectively, 20, 30 and 3  5 characters.
        #     | POD will apply property "keep-with-next" to the 2 last
        #     | paragraphs. The algorithm is the following: POD walks p_s's
        #     | paragraphs backwards, starting from the last one, counting and
        #     | adding the number of characters for every walked paragraph. POD
        #     | continues the walk until it reaches (or exceeds) the number of
        #     | characters to keep. When it is the case, it stops. All the
        #     | paragraphs walked so far receive property "keep-with-next".
        #     |
        #     | POD goes even one step further by applying "keep-with-next"
        #     | properties to tables as well. In the previous example, if, when
        #     | counting 60 characters backwards, we end up in the middle of a
        #     | table, POD will apply property "keep-with-next" to the whole
        #     | table. However, with tables spanning more than one page, there
        #     | is a problem: if property "keep-with-next" is applied to such a
        #     | table, LibreOffice will insert a page break at the beginning of
        #     | the table. This can be annoying. While this may be considered a
        #     | bug (maybe because it represents a constraint being particularly
        #     | hard to implement), it is the behaviour implemented in
        #     | LibreOffice, at least >= 3 and <= 6.4. Consequently, at the POD
        #     | level, an (expensive) workaround has been found: when
        #     | p_keepWithNext characters lead us inside a table, POD will split
        #     | it into 2 tables: a first table containing all the rows that
        #     | were not walked by the keep-with-next algorithm, and a second
        #     | containing the remaining, walked rows. On this second table
        #     | only, property "keep-with-next" is applied. Because splitting
        #     | tables that way requires LibreOffice running in server mode, as
        #     | soon as you specify p_keepWithNext > 1, POD wil assume
        #     | LibreOffice runs in server mode.

        # If p_keepImagesRatio is True, while importing images from "img" tags
        # within p_s, their width/height ratio will be kept. Note that in most
        # cases, it is useless to specify it, because POD computes the image's
        # real width and height.

        # Parameters p_imagesMaxWidth and p_imagesMaxHeight correspond,
        # respectively, to parameters p_maxWidth and p_maxHeight from POD

        # PX, set parameter p_inject to True. In that case, everytime such a
        # link will be encountered, it will replaced with the appropriate
        # content. In the case of an external Python source code file, POD will
        # retrieve it via a HTTP request and incorporate the part (class,
        # method..) specified in the link's "title" attribute, into the
        # resulting chunk of ODF code. If a PX is specified, it will be called
        # with the current PX context, and the result will be injected where the
        # link has been defined. For more information about this functionality,
        # check Appy's Rich field in class appy.model.fields.rich.c_Rich.
